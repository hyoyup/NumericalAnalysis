For the three ODE problems, followings are defined as default:

One-Dimensional ODE
Input: h=0.1, t_0=0, y_0=1, n=50
	f(t,y) = (5*t^2-y)/(e^(t+y))

	graph points: f(t,y) with respect to t

System ODE
Input: h=0.1, t_0=0 z_0=[1,2], n=50
	z = [x, y]
	f(t,z) = z' = [x', y']

	x' = t - x + y
	y' = 2t - 2x - y

	graph points: y' with respect to x'

Second Order ODE
Input: h=0.1, t_0=0, z_0=[1,0], n=50
	z = [y, v]
	f(t,z) = z' = [y', v']

	y' = v
	v' = cos(t) - y - v

	graph points: v' with respect to t

run:
	python Jacobi_GaussSeidel.py

how to change input.txt:
	- first line indicates n: size of the matrix (n x n)
	- then each line corresponds to the row of augmented matrix Ax = B
	- values of B is separated by a character ';' in each row

	**see also test.txt
	(provided input.txt has a system of 10x10 matrix)

how to change epsilon and x_0:
	- on the bottom of proj3.py:
		eps = 0.0001 	# epsilon currently set to 10^-4 
		x_0 = [0]*n	 	# x_0 currently set to 0
